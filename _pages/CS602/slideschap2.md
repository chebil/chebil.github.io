## Introduction

<span style="color:rgb(245, 172, 77)"><b>Datasets</b></span> are collections of facts about some aspect of the world. They can be used to encode information or in combination with Logic Programs to form more complex information systems.

- <span style="color:rgb(18, 241, 148)"><b>In this chapter we will:</b></span> 
  - Talk about conceptualizing the world. 
  - Use datasets to introduce a formal language for encoding information  about our conceptualization(using Epilog language).

## Conceptualization

When we think about the world, we usually think in terms of objects and relationships among these objects. 
- Objects include things like people, offices, buildings, and so forth.
- Relationships include things like parenthood, friendship, office assignments, office locations, and so forth.

## Conceptualization

One way to represent such information is in the form of graphs. 

we can represent such information in the form of tables or databases.
