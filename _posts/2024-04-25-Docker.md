In this post, I will explain a very indispensable tool for developers. **Docker** is a tool that allows developers to build, deploy, and run applications using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, the developer can be sure that the application will run on any other machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

## What is Docker?

The major issue when working with a development team is that the code works on one machine but not on another. This is because the environment on which the code is running is different. Docker solves this problem by providing a **container** that can run on any machine. 

A **container** is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 

A **Docker container image** is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

> **Note**: Docker containers are similar to virtual machines, but they are more portable, more resource-friendly, and more dependent on the host operating system. 

## Virtual Machine VS Docker

**Virtual Machines (VMs)** are more resource-intensive than Docker containers because they run a full copy of an operating system. While **Docker containers** share the host system's kernel and require only the application code and libraries to run.

## Let's get started with Docker

To get started with Docker, you need to install Docker on your machine. You can download Docker from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and follow the installation instructions.

> Once you have installed Docker, you can run the following command to verify the installation:
```bash
docker --version
```
You should see the Docker version installed on your machine. For example, if you have installed Docker version 20.10.7, you will see the following output:
```bash
Docker version 20.10.7, build f0df350
```

That's it! You are now ready to start using Docker to build, deploy, and run applications using containers.

### First example: python program running in a container

Let's begin by a Python program and run it in a Docker container. You don't need to have Python installed on your machine because the Python program will run inside the Docker container.

The Python program uses the 'pandas' and 'streamlit' libraries to read a CSV file and display it in a web application.

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it:
```bash
mkdir my-python-app
cd my-python-app
```
2. Create a new file named 'app.py' and add the following Python code to it:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

st.title('Employee Dashborad')
# read data from excel
df = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx')
#render the data in the web application
st.write(df)
```

3. Add the 'data.xlsx' file to the same directory as 'app.py'. You can download the sample data file from [here](/assets/data.xlsx).

4. Create a new file named 'requirements.txt' and add all the required libraries to it:

```txt
streamlit
pandas
```

5. Create a new file named 'Dockerfile' and add the following code to it:
> The Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. The name of the file is 'Dockerfile' with no file extension.

```Dockerfile
FROM python:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py"]
```
