# Project 1: Project management system
> The aim of this project is to implement a  program (java or python) that manages a list of tasks in a project. The program should be able to add, delete, and update tasks for a given project. Each task has a name, a description and a list of required tasks that should be completed before starting the current task. The program should be able to print the tasks in a project in a topological order. The program should be able to read the tasks from a file and write the ordred tasks to a file. 

# Project 2: Solving the maze problem
> This project is about solving the maze problem using a stack. The maze is represented as a 2D array of characters. The maze has a start point and an end point. The program should be able to read the maze from a file and print the solution to the maze. The solution should be printed as a sequence of moves (up, down, left, right). The program should be able to print the solution to a file.
> 
> The maze could be as the example below, where 'S' is the start point, 'D' is the end point, 'X' is a wall, 'O' is a free cell. 
```
['O' 'O' 'O' 'O' 'X'] 
['S' 'O' 'O' 'O' 'O'] 
['X' 'X' 'X' 'O' 'X'] 
['O' 'D' 'O' 'O' 'O'] 
['O' 'O' 'O' 'O' 'X']
```

> A solution to the above maze could be: 
```
right, right, right, down, down, left, left.
```
